                <Label  FontSize="18" Text="The follicular phase is defined as your first day of bleeding up until ovulation and is the phase where oestrogen takes centre stage. 
                        Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is produced from the pituitary gland which helps to prepare the ovaries to release an egg at ovulation. FSH encourages the growth of the ovarian follicles (which contain the eggs),which in turn produce oestrogen. 
                        One follicle is eventually chosen as the dominant follicle and will release its egg at ovulation. As FSH is released and as the follicle grows, more oestrogen is produced. The follicular phase is considered to be slightly more flexible in length and can be easily influenced by your environment such as exercise, diet, lifestyle and stress. This means that from cycle to cycle your follicular phase can vary in length.

 2.Phases of the Menstrual Cycle*

1. *Menstruation (Days 1-5)
    - Shedding of uterine lining
    - Bleeding (average 3-7 days)
    - Hormone levels: Estrogen and progesterone drop
2. *Follicular Phase (Days 6-14)*
    - Follicle growth in ovaries
    - Estrogen levels increase
    - Cervical mucus production"/>

                <Label FontSize="18" Text="Ovulation (the real star of the menstrual cycle!) is the release of an egg from the dominant ovarian follicle into the fallopian tube. This release of the egg is stimulated by the rising oestrogen levels in the first half of the cycle. Once oestrogen has reached a certain level it inhibits FSH and instead causes a surge of luteinising hormone (LH) which triggers the release of the egg from the ovaries.Ovulation occurs in the middle of your cycle, although it can vary.

                <Label FontAttributes="Bold" FontSize="18" Text="THE LUTEAL PHASE"/>
                <Label FontSize="18" Text="
The luteal phase is from ovulation to the first day of bleeding again. This phase is when the body prepares for possible pregnancy and the hormone progesterone takes centre stage.During this time the follicle that released the egg during ovulation begins to turn into the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces progesterone (and a small bit of oestrogen too). If there is no fertilisation of the egg during this month, the corpus luteum begins to break down.This causes a drop in both progesterone and oestrogen and begins the signalling for menstruation to occur.The luteal phase is generally more fixed in length than the follicular phase and typically lasts 13-15 days for most people. Therefore, if you count back 13-15 days from the start of menstruation it can help to pinpoint when you may be ovulating. It is important to note that it can be normal for a person’s luteal phase to be between 10-16 days depending on the individual. This is why understanding your own cycle is important.
3. *Ovulation (Day 14)*
    - Release of mature egg from ovary
    - Estrogen surge
    - Fertile window (12-24 hours)
4. *Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)*
    - Corpus luteum forms in ovary
    - Progesterone levels increase
    - Uterine lining thickens"/>

Paying attention to cycle length is important because it allows us to determine whether or not our cycles are regular or irregular. Irregular cycles are a common symptom of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hypothalamic amenorrhea, stress and perimenopause.

How to track the length of your cycle
Day 1 of the menstrual cycle is defined by your first day of a full bleed. You may experience some spotting before your period starts (typically a light or dark brown colour) but only start counting when you experience the first day of full flow.

What’s a normal cycle length? A normal cycle length is anywhere between 21 and 35 days. Interestingly only around 10-15% of women actually have a 28 day cycle!

What’s a normal amount of variation? A regular cycle is considered to be consistently the same length, give or take a couple of days. Natural fluctuations in a cycle are normal, so if your cycle is 31 days one month, and 35 days the next month, that’s still considered a regular cycle.The general rule is that the length of your menstrual cycle can vary up to 8 days in a year. For example, one cycle may be 30 days, another 28 and another 35. This would mean there was a variation of 7 days (between the shortest 28 and longest 35). 
Variation in cycle length Is normal in adolescence 
When you first start your menstrual cycle the first few years are likely to be irregular and this is normal. Your periods may also be heavier during this time as well. Troubleshooting
If your cycle is more than 35 days, or you consistently experience more than 8 days of variation each cycle then you are considered to have an irregular cycle.If you’ve recently started to experience shorter cycles and you’re in your late 30s or 40s, then this could be a sign of perimenopause.Does having a regular cycle always mean ovulation has occurred?Not necessarily. In a recent series of studies, lack of ovulation or anovulation was found to occur about 10-18% of the time in women. Ovulation is the real star of the menstrual cycle! So the next step in our tracking guide is all about ovulation.

                <Label FontSize="18" Text="Even if you’re not trying to get pregnant, it’s still a good idea to track your ovulation. Healthy ovulation is a sign of overall good health!
How to track ovulation We recommend tracking ovulation through a combination of i) observing your cervical mucus and ii) observing changes in your basal body temperature (or BBT).
Cervical Mucus
Cervical mucus is a component of vagnial discharge. It can be seen in your underwear or on toilet paper in different stages across the month.Our cervical mucus can change throughout the month in different textures and consistencies such as creamy, thick, stretchy, white, raw-egg-like and clear. These different colours and textures are a great indication as to what is happening with your hormones and can also help us track ovulation.Just before ovulation, higher oestrogen levels cause the glands in the cervix to make plenty of clear, stretchy cervical mucus - we call this fertile mucus. This helps the sperm to travel through the cervix when you are at your most fertile.During the luteal phase you will likely notice less cervical mucus because progesterone dries up your fertile mucus.As we age the amount of mucus decreases - you may not have as many fertile mucus days in your cycle. It is common in your 20’s and early 30’s to have around 5 days of fertile mucus and only 1-2 days in your late 30’s and 40’s.

How to Track Your Cervical Mucus 
It is important to check your cervical mucus before you use the bathroom. 
There are different ways of noting your cervical mucus, here are some terms that may help you to observe yours. 
Colour - White, clear, yellow, cloudy 
Feeling - Dry, wet, slippery, sticky, tacky
Texture - Thick, like raw egg white, thin, stretchy, tacky

Step 1: Before checking your cervical mucus, observe whether you can feel anything in your underwear - can you notice a wet sensation or does it feel dry?
Step 2: Insert a clean finger inside the vagina (ideally your middle or ring finger).
Step 3: You can also check your cervical mucus by wiping toilet paper at the opening of your vagina.
Step 4: When you pull your finger out or observe the toilet paper, roll the substance between your thumb and finger to check the colour and consistency. If the mucus stretches (ideally to about 3-5 cm long) as you pull your thumb and finger apart, and it’s clear-coloured, you are likely about to ovulate.
Step 5: Keep a note of changes in colour and consistency in our chart at the back of this guide. 
It is important to note that only checking your cervical mucus in your underwear throughout the day is not as reliable an indicator.

Cervical Mucus Across Your Cycle
Here is a basic breakdown of what each stage may look like: Follicular Phase - white, dry and tacky (it might feel a little sticky) or creamy, wet and cloudy.
Ovulation - clear-coloured, more watery and stretchy (like raw egg white).Luteal Phase - white, dry and sticky again, but for some people can be thicker and cloudier at this time too. 
Troubleshooting 
I’m seeing fertile mucus in my luteal phase This can indicate a possible hormone imbalance in progesterone and oestrogen – either your oestrogen is too high in relation to progesterone or you may be deficient in progesterone. 
I’m on the OCP, can I track my cervical mucus? If you are on the birth control pill it can thicken the cervical mucus so it will be a different consistency and texture. You also do not ovulate on the birth control pill and therefore will not see the above changes occur. 
What influences cervical mucus?
Cervical mucus quality can be influenced by your diet, hydration, stress levels and lifestyle. Alcohol, caffeine, medication use and stress can all reduce cervical mucus quality.

You may get a rise in oestrogen (and therefore changes in cervical mucus) that is not followed by ovulation, which is why it’s also important to track your temperature in conjunction with your cervical mucus in order to confirm.
Basal Body Temperature (BBT)

Your basal body temperature (BBT) is your body's lowest resting temperature. Your BBT is lowest during the first half of your cycle and rises by about 0.3 - 0.5 degrees centigrade after ovulation in response to progesterone being released from the corpus luteum (progesterone increases our metabolism slightly which causes the increase in temperature). 
How to Track Your BBT 
Step 1: Get a digital thermometer with readings accurate to at least 1 decimal place (for example, it can read 35.1, not just 35 degrees). 
Step 2: Every morning, first thing, before getting out of bed, take your temperature and record it in our printable temperature chart at the back of this guide. Make sure you take your temperature at the same time everyday, before you eat, drink or brush your teeth! 
Step 3: Observe the rise and fall in your temperature. If you see a consistent rise in temperature of at least 0.3 degrees across three days consistently, then ovulation has likely occurred. 
How long should the temperature rise last for? 
Professor Jerilynn Prior suggests that sustained higher temperature readings of at least 10 days are necessary for fertility. Any less than this you may not have enough days of high progesterone to allow the uterine lining (endometrium) to mature. 
What else can impact your BBT? 
Some days your readings may not be reliable. These include days when you’re unwell, have slept around 2 hours less than normal or drank alcohol the previous evening. Travel can also affect temperature. Simply make a note of this in the comments section of this tracker and continue the next day. Other Methods to Track Ovulation 
Ovulation Strips: Ovulation test strips can be bought at your local pharmacy. They track the surge in Luteinising Hormone (LH) which typically occurs 24-48 hours before you ovulate. However, even though you detect a surge in LH it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are going to ovulate. If you have PCOS, your reading may not be accurate as LH levels can be consistently elevated throughout the cycle. 
Cycle Apps: Cycle apps cannot accurately predict ovulation through an algorithm alone, unless you are using them to consistently track your BBT and cervical mucus. 
Troubleshooting 
I started tracking and I don't think I'm ovulating First of all, don’t panic! It’s normal to have the occasional anovulatory cycle. Stress, illness, travel, increased exercise and low-carb diets can all impact ovulation. If you track your cycle over a number of months and you don’t appear to be ovulating, then it’s a good idea to speak to your GP or seek out further testing at Future Woman to get to the root cause. 
My temperature rise lasts less than 10 days 
This could be a sign of a shorter luteal phase, which is common in perimenopause . This may also be a sign of an imbalance in oestrogen and progesterone. We offer different tests at Future Woman that can help you understand why this might be the case. 
When is the best time to get pregnant? 
Conception can occur up to 5 days before ovulation and 12–24 hours afterwards. According to Professor Prior, the days of stretchy cervical mucus before you’ve ovulated are the best days to conceive. That’s because the sperm needs to be ready and waiting as the egg makes its way down the fallopian tube towards the uterus.

It is normal to see black, brown and dark red blood as this is the colour it can turn when it interacts with oxygen, which is especially common if the blood is on a pad. If you are seeing dark brown blood before your period this may be due to the fact that it’s blood that took longer to leave the uterus so can be common at the beginning and end of your period.
